# The exchange of information between partners in the value chain of Industrie 4.0 (Version 3.0RC02)   


## Editorial notes
This document, version 3.0RC02, was produced from November 2020 to May 2022 by the sub working group “Asset Administration Shell” of the joint Working Group of Platform Industrie 4.0 Working Group “Reference Architectures, Standards and Norms“ and the “Open Technology” Working Group of the Industrial Digital Twin Association.

## Scope of this Document
The aim of this document is to make selected specifications of the structure of the Administration Shell in such a way that information about assets and I4.0 Components can be exchanged in a meaningful way between partners in a value creation network.
This part of this document therefore focuses on the question of how such information needs to be processed and structured. In order to make these specifications, the document formally stipulates a few structural principles of the Administration Shell. This part does not describe technical interfaces of the Administration Shell or other systems to exchange information, protocols or interaction patterns.
This document focuses on:
	Metamodel for specifying information of an Asset Administration Shell and its submodels
	Exchange format for the transport of information from one partner in the value chain to the next
	Identifiers
	Access Control
	Introduction to the need of mappings to suitable technologies to be used in different life cycle phases of a product: XML, JSON, RDF, AutomationML and OPC UA
This document assumes some familiarity with the concept of the Asset Administration Shell. For convenience some of the concepts are repeated in the Annex A. The concepts are being standardized as IEC standard IEC 63278 series [59]. The main stakeholders addressed in this document are architects and software developers aiming to implement a digital twin using the Asset Administration Shell in an interoperable way. Additionally, the content can also be used as input for discussions with international standardization organisations and further collaborations. For an overview on documents on the Asset Administration Shell please see the continuously updated reading guide [50]. The reading guide gives advice which documents to read depending on the role of the reader.
